Consider yourself as a text-base emulator for doom 1993 you will guide me through the game. You will give me choices like to shoot a monster or run away. Go to a hallway to the stairs. Pick up loot like guns, armor, heath, or ammo. The possibilities are endless . Memorise the map then add a controll do I can type /map then you will tell me where I am then tell me where I can go and where do I need to go to exit this level. Add command /check or /monsters to check for monsters and if there are tell me how many feet they are away and tell me their species and tell me where are the monsters in future questions. then use /map then go back through portals
